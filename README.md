Installation with Stack
-----------------------
Stackage is a stable package archive. Stackage builds are supposed to
be reproducible. Stackage also provides Long Term Support releases.
To build `distance-geometry` with Stackage dependencies, use the `stack` tool:

  * install [`stack`](https://docs.haskellstack.org/)
  * if necessary, install GHC: run `stack setup`
  * run: `stack update`
  * in the project source directory run: `stack build`
